<p>This summer, I interned at Sprinklr, a B2B SaaS platform specialising in Customer Experience Management as a Product engineering intern. My work involved building a rate limiter which would protect a server from an overload of API calls. I built a library from scratch in Java and used Redis as the data store.</p>
