I am Aditya Trivedi, a third year undergraduate at [IIT Guwahati](https://iitg.ac.in). I am pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering along with Minors in Product Design. My major CPI is 9.44/10 and minor CPI is 10.00. 

Currently, I am a research intern at the MIST Lab at Polytechnique Montreal, where I am working on developing a Software-In-The-Loop(SITL) for the [CogniFly Drone](https://thecognifly.github.io/) based on pre-existing SITLs. 

I enjoy competitive programming and am active on sites such as [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/trivedi), [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/adityat25) and [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/trivedi). I have solved over 1000 problems on these websites and am ranked as an expert on Codeforces and have max. rating of 1700. I also have taken lectures on competitive coding for beginners and made contests. 

In my free time, I browse the internet for memes, fun trivia and articles on tech, politics and daily life. I enjoy quizzing and debating and am a core team member of the quiz club of my college.

I am part of the [CSEA](https://www.facebook.com/iitgcsea) team, previously as a Technical Manager and now as Technical & Events Executive. I have organised various talks and events for the IITG community. The team and I were responsible for the orientation of over 100 CSE freshers and am a mentor for 5 of them.
